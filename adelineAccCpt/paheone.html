      <h2 class="w3-text-teal">What is a CPA?</h2>
      <p>A CPA is commonly described as a strategic thinker, trusted adviser and financial helper. They create value for businesses and economies by providing insight and leverage to a business decision, using their data and analytical expertise. It is also essentially the unification of Certified General Accountants (CGAs), Certified Management Accountants (CMAs) and Chartered Accountants (CAs).</p>
      <p>Unique competencies: People who have a CPA designation can use it on social media, business cards make and hard copy signature blocks, individual names listed on letterhead and all references to members names in marketing plus advertising. They may also use it as a part of their firm’s name.</p>

      <h2 id="DEF" class="w3-text-teal">Values, Vision, Mission, Principals</h2>
      <p>According to CPA Ontario, "PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC INTEREST IS AT THE CORE OF [THEIR] PROFESSION." Some of their other <b>values</b> include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Thinking and acting with a students and member first mindset</li>
        <li>Maintaining and striving for high levels of professionalism</li>
        <li>Being open-minded, especially when adapting to a new and evolving environment</li>
        <li>Personal accountability</li>
        <li>Acting with integrity</li>
        <li>Possessing a "one company" mindset</li>
        <li>Focusing activities and efforts onto the bigger picture</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The phrase they identify with for their <b>vision</b> is, "The Canadian CPA is the pre-eminent, globally respected business and accounting designation."</p>
      <p>To rephrase their <b>mission</b> statement, CPA Ontario guarantees that their members, students, appliacants and firms meet high standards of their values, in order to protect the public intrest.</p>
      <p><b>Guiding Principals:</b> CPAs follow the Code of Professional Conduct, which is derived from the five fundemental principles of ethics:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Professional Behaviour</li>
        <li>Integrity and Due Care</li>
        <li>Objectivity</li>
        <li>Professional Competence</li>
        <li>Confidentiality</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Although a CPA, CFA and CFP can be categorized as financial professionals and they are reputable designations, doesn't mean that they will satisfy every businesses needs. To clarify, different responsibilities are expected from each designation.</p>
      <p>A CPA designation is required for performing some corporate accounting duties, such as auditing a financial statement. But if you simply need help preparing your personal taxes, it isn’t always necessary to hire a tax preparer with the letters “CPA” after their name. Many bookkeepers and tax preparation professionals can get the job done expertly and at a lower price than one would have to pay a CPA.
      Professionals with CFA after their names have acquired advanced knowledge in the fields of investment management and financial analysis of stocks, bonds and their derivative assets. Their educational program focuses on portfolio management and financial analysis, and they usually perform work for companies rather than individuals.
      One might consider hiring a professional with the CFP designation if you are looking for someone to manage your investments or assist you with financial planning.</p>
